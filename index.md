# Me and my plans
---

*So, the main point is to understand the mission while going through it.*

**The plan for now:**

- [ ] Create a Commercial Laboratory  
- [ ] Create a Clinic  
- [ ] Create a Medical University  

## Part one, *the* laboratory:

- [ ] MD degree as the basic part of my career needed ***because I love it***, to gain experience in clinic, understand internal structure, networking.
- [ ] PhD combined with medical experience to gain profound research skills and understand the structure of working laboratory.
- [ ] Estimate my level and gain extra communication skills in Medical-Research field to rule the lab.
- [ ] Commercial skills? And from which projects they can be gained. Should it be the first checkbox to tick?

## Part two, the clinic

- [ ] Fundraising and skills in business from scailing up business model of laboratory?

## Part three, the Medical University

- [ ] To understand where to start!
