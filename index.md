# Me and my plans

So, the main point is to understand the mission while going through it.

## The plan for now

- [ ] Create a Commercial Laboratory
- [ ] Create a Clinic
- [ ] Create a Medical University

### Part One: The Laboratory

- [ ] MD degree as the basic part of my career needed because I love it, to gain experience in clinic, understand internal structure, networking.
- [ ] PhD combined with medical experience to gain profound research skills and understand the structure of working laboratory.
- [ ] Estimate my level and gain extra communication skills in Medical-Research field to rule the lab.
- [ ] Commercial skills? And from which projects they can be gained. Should it be the first checkbox to tick?

### Part Two: The Clinic

- [ ] Fundraising and skills in business from scaling up the laboratory's business model.

### Part Three: The Medical University

- [ ] To understand where to start!
